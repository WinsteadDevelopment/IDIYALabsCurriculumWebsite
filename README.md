# IDIYALabsCurriculumWebsite
Website to deliver curriculum for IDIYA Labs 

To Research:

- Bootstrap website template with auth
- self destructing PDF's
- preventing copy and paste information from website
- restricting screen shots
- database hosting with CRUD from front end admin
- server API creation
- front end security powerful enough for school standards (what are those standards if any?)
